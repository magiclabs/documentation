The Magic **React Native** JavaScript SDK is distributed **from the same NPM package as our**[ **Browser JavaScript SDK**](../browser-js/)**!** This is your entry-point to secure, passwordless authentication for your iOS or Android-based React Native app. This guide will cover some important topics for getting started with client-side APIs and to make the most of Magic's features.

**👉 Go to our** [**Getting Started**](get-started.md) **tutorial to begin your integration**
